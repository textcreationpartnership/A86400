#####Body#####

1. THE HISTORY Of the Life of the ſublime and illuminated Divine, Dr. John Thauler, who at Colin (where he lived) was in an Extraordinary and Miraculous manner turned from his vain Converſation to an Extraordinary degree of Sanctity, and Holineſs of Life.
IN the year of our Lord, One thouſand three hundred forty ſix, there lived a Doctor of Divinity in C
    _ It follows how the Layman did in ſecret partly diſcover to the Doctor his hidden Sanctity, and how he convinced him that he was yet in the night of Ignorance, and that his Veſſel was unclean, and that himſelf was of the number of the Phariſees.

    _ This enſuing Diſcourſ• contains a Narration, what wonderful and ſtupendious things God did work by this Layman, and alſo how for this cauſe beſides others, he obtained ſo great Grace and Favour, becauſe God found in him an abſolute reſigned up humility.

    _ This following Diſcourſe, ſhows how the Lord was pleaſed to Convert by the means of this Layman, a certain Pagan that lived in a far Country. It ſhews likewiſe how the Holy Ghoſt even at this day doth pour forth the ſame Virtue and Grace, upon minds that he finds apt and well prepared to receive it, that he did upon the Apoſtles at the day of Penticoſt: As alſo it ſheweth, how this Layman did at large explain theſe things to the Doctor; and how by plain and clear Reaſons he proved the Doctor to be a Phariſee, and at laſt brought him to this, that he reſolved fully with himſelf to take a new courſe, and amend his life.

    _ How the Doctor ſoon, though not without labour, truly learn'd the Alphabetical Inſtitution: How afterward the Layman taught him a nearer way to perfection. Moreover, how the Doctor was fain to enter upon a dying Life; and therein ſo long exerciſed himſelf, until he had overcome himſelf.

    _ What afterwards befel the Doctor. How he endured grievous preſſures in his nature, and underwent the contempt of men, inſomuch that his ſtrength began to fail him.

    _ How the Doctor was wonderfully viſited, touched, and illuminated by God: and how the Layman returned to him again, and meekly exerted him, that he ſhould again take upon him the care of Preaching, which for ſome time had been omitted.

    _ Of certain wonderful Things, which befel ſome upon the Hearing the foregoing Sermon, which afterwards were underſtood. From whence we may take notice, How great things God worketh by fit Inſtruments; namely, by the Sermon of any one Illuminated Mans, much more then by the Sermons of an hundred others.

    _ How after this Sermon, the Maſter was forbidden by his Brethren to Preach again.

    _ Of the DEATH of the MASTER, and how after his Departure he appeared to his Friend the LAYICK, giving him an account of his ſevere and horrible departure out of the body; declaring that he endured that inſtead of his Purgatory: and alſo aſſuring him of that huge Joy, and everlaſting Felicity, which he had obtained from God by means of his wholſome Doctrine.
